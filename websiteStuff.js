    Hi, I am an game-developer, working mostly with 2d games.
    I have a background in computer science as a Sophomore at Florida Polytechnic University.
    While learning to code games, I tend to make small demos to test out specific systems, and have picked up some skills for making websites.
    I love making game for people to enjoy.
